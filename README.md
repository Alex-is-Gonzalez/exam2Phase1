# Exam 2: Mock Interview: JavaScript 30 - Array Cardio Challenge

# Objective

In this mock technical interview, you will act as the candidate while your instructor plays the role of the interviewer. You will be evaluated on your ability to approach a problem systematically using the PREP method (Parameters, Results, Examples/Edge Cases, and Pseudocode) before implementing your solution in JavaScript.

# Before the Exam

Clone the following repository: exam2Phase1.
Ensure your development environment is set up and ready to run JavaScript.
You must share your IDE screen for the duration of the exam to allow real-time observation and feedback.

# Interview Process

Each candidate will be randomly assigned one of the following six JavaScript challenges using the data and exercises provided from WesBos Js30 Array Cardio Day 1. You must first outline your thought process using the PREP method before proceeding with implementation.

1. Filter Method: Use `.filter()` to create an array of inventors born in the 1500s.
2. Map Method: Use `.map()` to create an array of the inventors' first and last names.
3. Sort Method: Use `.sort()` to order the inventors by birth year, oldest to youngest.
4. Reduce Method: Use `.reduce()` to calculate the total number of years all the inventors lived.
5. Sort by Years Lived: Use `.sort()` to rank inventors by the number of years they lived.
6. Sort by Last Name: Use `.sort()` to locate a specific inventor based on last name (alphabetical order)
7. Reduce the instance: Use `.reduce()` Sum up the instances of each of the modes of transportation in the data array

# Evaluation Criteria:

Your performance will be assessed based on: (14 points)
<br><br/>
Clear articulation of your thought process using the PREP method. (up to 8 points)

### PREP Steps:

- **Parameters:** Clearly define the input and output. (2 points)
- **Results:** Describe the expected outcome. (2 points)
- **Examples & Edge Cases:** Provide sample inputs and edge cases.(2 points)
- **Pseudocode:** Outline your approach in plain English before writing JavaScript.(2 points)

A well-structured and efficient JavaScript solution. (2 points)
<br><br/>
Proper use of ES6+ syntax, including const, let, arrow functions, and template literals. (2 points)
<br><br/>
Console logs demonstrating expected output. (2 points)

## Mock Interview Guidelines

You may discuss general JavaScript concepts with the interviewer but should not receive direct help on solving the problem.
Ask clarifying questions as needed to refine your understanding of the problem.
Walk through your thought process out loud before beginning your implementation.
This interview will take approximately 15 minutes. Your ability to communicate and think critically is just as important as writing correct code.

#### Good luck!
